# LWA (`lwa` CLI)

> **Lark Local Agent Workbench (LWA)** — local multi-agent gateway (Feishu / terminal), with smart routing and observability.
>
> Bridge local **Agent CLIs** to Feishu / Lark — chat code, run commands, and operate Feishu itself. Simple tasks use Cursor Auto; complex tasks upgrade to Kiro automatically.

> **CLI**: primary command **`lwa`** (aliases: `lwa-bridge`, `lark-kiro-bridge`). Data dir **`~/.lwa`** (auto-migrates from `~/.lark-kiro-bridge`). See [docs/MIGRATION_LWA.md](./docs/MIGRATION_LWA.md).

---

`@bot` in a group chat or DM the bot directly. Your message goes to local `kiro-cli acp` over **ACP (Agent Client Protocol)**. Replies stream back as **structured cards with native typing cursor**. Each chat keeps an isolated session, and switching directories doesn't lose context.

**Why this exists**: cloud AI coding assistants (Cursor / Copilot / Devin) can't touch your local project directories, and have no way to operate Feishu's own APIs. Bridge **=** running local commands inside Feishu **+** orchestrating Feishu APIs from chat — one bot for both.

**LWA stack**: Bridge handles Feishu chat and light tasks; long-running parallel work goes to [Conduit (kiro-conduit)](https://github.com/walterwang0x01/lwa-conduit). See [docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](./docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md).

## ✨ Features

- 🎴 **Structured cards** — Rendered from ACP structured events: each tool call gets its own collapsible panel showing Kiro's real title, type-based icon, and execution result; multi-call groups auto-condense; reasoning gets its own panel
- ⚡ **Streaming typing cursor** — Native Feishu `streaming_mode` + footer status indicator
- 🗂️ **Workspace plan B** — `/cd` doesn't drop context: per-`(chat, cwd)` Kiro session map auto-resumes
- 🔘 **Clickable buttons** — `/model` `/help` `/status` `/ws list` `/config` are all interactive cards, zero command memorization
- 📝 **`/config` in-Feishu form** — Edit access control & preferences inside Feishu, takes effect instantly, anti-lockout validation
- 🚄 **Rapid-fire message merging** — Multiple short messages within 200ms merge into a single Kiro call, no more abort-and-retry
- ⏰ **`/cron` scheduled tasks** — Accepts standard cron, shorthand (`@daily`), and Chinese keywords; falls back to Kiro translation with two-step confirmation. "Every day 9am summarize yesterday's commits" — done.
- 📅 **`/schedule new` visual form** — For non-engineers (HR / Sales / Ops): fill in hour, minute, and content. No cron syntax needed. Shares the same backing store as `/cron`.
- 🧠 **`/steering` to manage Kiro instruction files in Feishu** — list/view/edit/new/rm, global or project scope, edit via in-Feishu form, persists permanently
- 🎤 **Voice input** — Send a voice message in Feishu → auto-transcribed (Feishu ASR) → fed to Kiro. Requires `ffmpeg` and ASR scope.
- 🛡️ **Graceful termination** — Abort/timeout sends ACP `session/cancel` first, then `SIGTERM→SIGKILL` after 2s as fallback
- ⏱ **Idle watchdog** — Stuck process auto-killed; tunable globally and per-chat
- 🔐 **Three-tier access control** — User / chat / admin allowlists. **DMs always bypass the chat allowlist** so you can never lock yourself out.
- 🐧 **Cross-platform daemon** — macOS launchd / Linux systemd --user / Windows Task Scheduler. Auto-restart on crash, login auto-start.
- 🖥️ **`/ps` `/exit` process management** — List host bridge processes from Feishu, stop with one button
- 📊 **`/doctor` self-diagnosis** — Feed logs back to Kiro to analyze its own failures
- 🖥️ **Web Dashboard** — Read-only local console at `http://127.0.0.1:5180` (sessions/cron/processes/skills/logs), built with Vue 3, ships pre-built — open in a browser, no setup. Pair with Tailscale for phone access.
- 🚦 **`/conduit`** — Bridges to [kiro-conduit](https://github.com/walterwang0x01/lwa-conduit), a multi-agent parallel orchestrator: run a big spec from Feishu in one line (`plan` to decompose, `run` to execute, `--merge` with confirmation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS / Linux / Windows
- Node.js ≥ 20
- `kiro-cli` installed and logged in
- A Feishu / Lark account (personal edition is fine — the QR wizard auto-creates the app)
- **Optional**: `ffmpeg` for voice input (`brew install ffmpeg` / `apt install ffmpeg`) + Feishu `speech_to_text:speech` scope (free-tier tenants are not supported)

### 30-second setup ⚡

```bash
# 1. Install
npm i -g lark-kiro-bridge

# 2. Run (first launch shows a QR — scan, approve, done)
lwa run
```

> **That's it** — scanning the QR in Feishu auto-creates the app, writes credentials, and grants required permissions.

DM the bot "hi" — you should see a streaming card immediately.

### Already have a Feishu app?

If you've manually created an app on the Feishu Open Platform and want to reuse the App ID/Secret:

```bash
lwa init --manual
# Interactive prompts for App ID and Secret
```

Or one-line:

```bash
lwa init --app-id cli_xxx --app-secret xxx
```

> Manual Feishu console setup (subscribe `im.message.receive_v1` + `card.action.trigger`) → [docs/FAQ.md](./docs/FAQ.md)

### Background daemon (recommended for production)

```bash
lwa start          # Install platform service and start
lwa status         # Check status
lwa restart        # Restart
```

Platform mapping:

| Platform | Implementation | Service path |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | launchd user agent | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.lwa.bot.plist` |
| **Linux** | systemd user unit | `~/.config/systemd/user/lwa.service` |
| **Windows** | Task Scheduler ONLOGON | Task `LWA.Bot`, launcher `~/.lwa/daemon-launcher.cmd` |

> Linux: to keep the daemon running after logout (servers), run once:
> `loginctl enable-linger $USER`

### 📊 Web Dashboard

The bridge starts a read-only local console when it runs. Open it in any browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5180
```

Shows: session state for every Feishu chat, scheduled tasks, host bridge processes, your `~/.kiro/skills` catalog, and recent logs (auto-refreshes every 5s). Read-only — no write operations exposed.

Enabled by default; change the port via `dashboard.port` in `config.json`, or set `dashboard.enabled: false` to turn it off.

**Access from your phone**:

```bash
tailscale serve 5180
```

Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and open the URL it gives you from your phone's browser — still only visible to your own devices.

## 📖 Slash Commands

### Daily commands (everyone)

| Command | Aliases | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/help` | `/h` `/?` | Help card with action buttons |
| `/status` | `/s` | Current cwd / session / watchdog |
| `/model [name]` | `/m` | View / switch / reset model with one click |
| `/new` | `/reset` | Reset Kiro session for current cwd |
| `/stop` | `/abort` | Abort the running task |
| `/pwd` | `/cwd` | Current working directory |
| `/ws list` | — | List named workspaces with switch buttons |
| `/timeout [N\|off]` | `/to` | Idle watchdog threshold (minutes) |
| `/runtime [profile]` | — | View / switch runtime profile (`kiro` / `cursor` / `gemini` / `openai`) |
| `/runtime check` | — | Check availability, missing config, and quota state for all runtime profiles |
| `/ps` | — | List all bridge processes on this host |
| `/steering` | `/memory` `/mem` | List Kiro steering files for current project (card + buttons) |
| `/cron` | `/schedule` | List scheduled tasks for current chat (card + buttons) |
| `/doctor [desc]` | — | Let Kiro inspect logs and diagnose |

### Admin commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/config` | View / edit access control & preferences (in-Feishu form, applies instantly) |
| `/cd <path>` | Switch working directory (gated by `allowedRoots`) |
| `/ws save <name>` | Save current cwd as a named workspace |
| `/ws use <name>` | Switch to a named workspace |
| `/ws remove <name>` | Delete a named workspace |
| `/steering edit/new/rm <name>` | Edit / create / delete a steering file |
| `/cron add <expr> <prompt>` | Add a scheduled task; expr accepts cron / `@daily` / Chinese keywords |
| `/cron rm/pause/resume/run <id>` | Delete/pause/resume/manually run a task |
| `/schedule new` | Open a form card to create a scheduled task without cron syntax (covers "every day H:M") |
| `/exit <id\|#>` | Stop a bridge process (self / others) |
| `/reconnect` | Force reconnect Feishu WebSocket |
| `/conduit run [--merge]` | Run [kiro-conduit](https://github.com/walterwang0x01/lwa-conduit) (current directory needs a `dag.yaml`); `--merge` triggers a confirmation card |
| `/conduit plan <spec.md>` | Have Kiro decompose a markdown spec into a `dag.yaml` workspace |

> By default everyone is admin (`access.admins` empty). Tighten before sharing with a team.

**Trigger rules**: DMs respond to anything; group chats require `@bot`; `@all` is never answered.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Minimum (auto-generated)

`lwa init` writes `~/.lark-kiro-bridge/config.json`:

```json
{
  "lark": {
    "appId": "cli_xxxxxxxxxxx",
    "appSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

All other fields have sensible defaults.

```json
{
  "lark": {
    "appId": "cli_xxxxxxxxxxx",
    "appSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "kiro": {
    "binPath": "kiro-cli",
    "trustedTools": [
      "fs_read", "fs_write", "grep", "glob", "code",
      "execute_bash", "web_search", "web_fetch"
    ],
    "timeoutMs": 600000,
    "idleTimeoutMinutes": 5,
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4.6"
  },
  "workspace": {
    "defaultCwd": "/Users/you/Projects",
    "allowedRoots": ["/Users/you/Projects"]
  },
  "access": {

  },
  "preferences": {
    "requireMentionInGroup": true,
    "cardUpdateIntervalMs": 800,
    "logRetentionDays": 7
  }
}
```

**`trustedTools`** — Tools Kiro can invoke without asking:
- `fs_read fs_write grep glob code` — File and code operations
- `execute_bash` — Run shell commands (lark-cli / git / etc). **Safe for personal use; evaluate for team scenarios**
- `web_search web_fetch` — Internet search

**`access`** — Three-tier allowlists, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md):
- Empty `allowedUsers` = everyone allowed
- Empty `allowedChats` = every chat allowed
- Empty `admins` = everyone is admin

**`workspace.allowedRoots`** — Whitelist of directories `/cd` can reach. Limits blast radius.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs and issues welcome. Dev flow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walterwang0x01/lwa-bridge.git
cd lark-kiro-bridge
pnpm install                                # pnpm workspace, installs dashboard-ui deps too
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test    # required before commit
pnpm build                                  # builds dashboard-ui first, then tsup
node bin/lark-kiro-bridge.mjs run           # local run (stop daemon first)
```

Conventions: TypeScript strict / Biome lint / vitest tests / conventional commits. `dashboard-ui/` (the Web Dashboard frontend) is an independent Vue 3 + Vite subproject; its `.vue` files are type-checked via `vue-tsc` (already chained into `pnpm typecheck`), while biome only covers its `.ts` files.

## Roadmap

- **v0.2** ✅ Current (structured cards + button callbacks + Slack-style tool panels + QR app binding + voice input via ASR)
- **v0.3** ✅ In-Feishu `/config` form + three-tier access control (DM bypass) + rapid-fire message merging
- **v0.4** ✅ Linux systemd / Windows Task Scheduler daemon + `/ps` `/exit` in-Feishu process management
- **v0.5** ✅ `/steering` to manage Kiro instruction files in Feishu (list/view/edit/new/rm, global/project scope)
- **v0.6** ✅ `/cron` scheduled tasks (cron / shorthand / Chinese keywords; LLM fallback with two-step confirmation)
- **v0.7** ✅ `/schedule new` visual form (no cron syntax for non-engineers) + `/selftest` health checks + fix Feishu form 200530 hidden bug
- **v0.8** ✅ Quoted-reply / merge-forward context restore + empty-task card discard + task plan card
- **v0.9** ✅ Migrated Kiro integration to ACP (Agent Client Protocol): JSON-RPC over stdio, structured tool events drive cards, no more stdout parsing
- **v0.10** ✅ Read-only Web Dashboard (Vue 3; sessions/cron/processes/skills/logs) + `/conduit` bridging to kiro-conduit's multi-agent parallel orchestration
- **v1.0** Centralized server deployment / multi-user isolation / actionable dashboard (trigger tasks from the browser)
